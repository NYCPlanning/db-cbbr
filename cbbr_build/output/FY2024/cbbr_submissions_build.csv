The beauty of Ocean Parkway must not be allowed to deteriorate. Some of our elected officials have designated monies for the upgrade and beautification of the Malls. Maintenance must be ongoing to make sure the upgrades and beautification remain intact. In order to maintain this arena in a sanitary and groomed condition, a crew should be assigned to maintain this thoroughfare and prevent homeless people from sleeping on the benches. An additional crew cab truck is requested to transport them the length and breadth of this roadway.

1. Repave the ground to be exactly like that of the basketball court.
2. Open the center and leave free of features/obstacles for acceleration/deceleration and free skating on flat ground.
3. Line the perimeter of the skate park with the same height and style ledges as the basketball courts.

We can help communities understand what exactly a BID can do and whether it is the best option for them.

Once a BID is identified as the best option for a community, a group of local stakeholders form a Steering Committee to lead the formation effort. The Steering Committee decides the key details of the BID plan: the boundaries, services to be provided, annual budget, and assessment formula.

We serve as an advisor and resource during the BID formation process, guiding these groups through the planning, outreach, and legislative phases of the BID formation process, and then through the start-up of the newly established BID.

The Comprehensive Guide to BID Formation and Expansion explains the multi-year process to form a new BID or expand an existing BID.

The project will also include a greenway along the banks of the restored Brook, connecting to the existing greenway in Van Cortlandt Park and northward to the 750-mile Empire State Trail. 

Once completed, the daylighting initiative will remove roughly 4 to 5 million gallons of water from the Bronx sewer system each day, more on rainy days. The resulting additional capacity in the sewer system will help to reduce sewer overflows into the Harlem River and could lessen flooding in some areas of the Broadway corridor, while diverting brook water away from the Wards Island Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility, which reduces treatment costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

Please visit nyc.gov/SBS for more information.,8,This request requires further study,"The community must initiate the creation of a BID. The effort can take a long time and involves the hard work of property owners, businesses, and other local stakeholders. A BID is one of many ways to improve a commercial district. We can help communities understand what exactly a BID can do and whether it is the best option for them.

Once a BID is identified as the best option for a community, a group of local stakeholders form a Steering Committee to lead the formation effort. The Steering Committee decides the key details of the BID plan: the boundaries, services to be provided, annual budget, and assessment formula.

We serve as an advisor and resource during the BID formation process, guiding these groups through the planning, outreach, and legislative phases of the BID formation process, and then through the start-up of the newly established BID.

The Comprehensive Guide to BID Formation and Expansion explains the multi-year process to form a new BID or expand an existing BID. The guide provides detailed instructions and advice for local stakeholders to progress through the planning, outreach, legislation, and start-up phases of BID formation. Forming a BID can take a long time and involves the hard work of property owners, businesses, and other local stakeholders.
