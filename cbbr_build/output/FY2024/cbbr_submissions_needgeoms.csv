Once a BID is identified as the best option for a community, a group of local stakeholders form a Steering Committee to lead the formation effort. The Steering Committee decides the key details of the BID plan: the boundaries, services to be provided, annual budget, and assessment formula.

We serve as an advisor and resource during the BID formation process, guiding these groups through the planning, outreach, and legislative phases of the BID formation process, and then through the start-up of the newly established BID.
