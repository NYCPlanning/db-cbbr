To exercise this option, the DOE must fund the school by Dec. 31, 2018 and start construction by July 31, 2020.  The DOE may build a school to serve students through 8th grade (not high school students.) If the DOE does not exercise this option, the buildable rights revert to NYU and NYU would allocate no less than 25,000 square feet of above grade space for a community facility.  In addition, under the Restrictive Declaration, NYU has the right to build up to 70,000 square feet of below grade space.

Many trees have died over the years and have not been replaced. This causes trip hazards to pedestrians and creates an unmanaged appearance. Property owners eventually remove the pits causing the loss of a valuable tree location and an additional cost to the City when the tree is replanted.,,,Department of Parks and Recreation,Capital,21,New Capital Request,302201822C,2015,"No, this is a request for our community more generally",,,,,,,,,Plant New Street Trees,,DPR,,,,
