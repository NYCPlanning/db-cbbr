Full reconstruction of the existing bicycle and pedestrian path is desperately needed, including repaving the existing asphalt path, installing new park security lighting, and reconstructing sections of the existing rip rap edge and the landscape between the Henry Hudson Parkway and Hudson River. The Cherry Walk is part of the Hudson River Greenway. Since it was  constructed nearly two decades ago, and particularly as other sections of the Greenway to the north and south of this segment have been opened, the number of cyclists using the Cherry Walk, both commuters and recreational cyclists, has exploded. The Cherry Walk is also heavily used by walkers and runners.

Sufficient park workers are needed to meet work requirements for the cleaning and maintenance of the 229.7 acres of parks in CD5Q.  Currently, there are only 12 Parks Dept. maintenance staff, including supervisors, assigned for this massive parkland.  Skilled maintenance workers (there are only 2 for all of Queens Districts 5, 9, 10 & Forest Park) should be funded year-round.  Depending almost totally on POP workers to maintain parks shows a lack of concern for what to many is a most important community asset.

The jogging path around the ball fields is very narrow and there isn't any security lighting in this part of the park.
