Palmetto Street serves as an important local artery, especially for numerous bus lines that take passengers to and from the Myrtle and Wyckoff Avenues Transit Hub.  Engineered resurfacing at a minimum is needed along Palmetto Street, from St. Nicholas Avenue to Seneca Avenue, as the roadway is in disrepair.  Street conditions are complicated by the fact that the pillars supporting the elevated ""M"" Train are located in the bed of the roadway.
